# Riddle
This game has finished and no longer playable. 
Riddle game I did on my first summer of university, inspired by the game I really enjoyed playing, DHRiddle. Consisted of 5 questions that require heavy research to solve, all questions were solved in a week with a total of 2000~ participants.
Example of the way it is designed, the game is sort of like a "race", every question is harder then the past question and it is shown on the page who first solved the question that that has been the last question solved so far.
